Provided is a small data analysis project that answers the following questions:
1.	Which vineyard produces the best wine?
2.	If you had to pick 3 wines to recommend using only this data, which would you pick?
3.	Which of the factors (price, country, variety, taster) are most important in determining the overall score of a wine?
4.	Lastly, if I typically enjoy a wine which is “dry” and has “citrus” flavours, which variety of wine should I try?  

A presentation outlining techniques used to analyse data as well as conclusions derived has been attached.
